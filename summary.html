Death of Orban constitutes vacation of office; temporary incapacitation due to routine medical procedure does not. Whether prolonged medical incapacitation (e.g. coma) constitutes vacation of office will be determined on a case-by-case basis by a subject matter expert familiar with Hungarian succession law.
