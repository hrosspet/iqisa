Make fields for prediction market data and survey data consistent
	What about prices before & after trades?

Import all previously implemented aggregation & scoring rules
	Also write an aggregation rule that takes into account previous performance by forecasters

Finish documentation
	Describe all fields returned by `get_survey_forecasts` and `get_market_forecasts`

Market data
	This lacks the options that were bet on (`answer_option`), why?
		Could it be that `outcome` in some files is actually the answer option?
	Why do we get more forecasts when we add question ids and outcomes?

Better Brier score
Get probabilities out of prediction market data
Forecasters ranked by previous performance
Finally execute it on the whole data
