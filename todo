General
	add_cumul_user_perc is super slow, any chance to make it faster?
	Import all previously implemented aggregation & scoring rules
		Also write an aggregation rule that takes into account previous performance by forecasters
	Better Brier score

Make fields for prediction market data and survey data consistent
	What about prices before & after trades?

Finish documentation
	Describe all fields returned by `get_survey_forecasts` and `get_market_forecasts`

Data in general
	Unify fields, think about better names for fields
	Field order:
	{general} question_id, user_id, probability, answer_option, timestamp,
	{question} outcome, date_start, date_suspend, date_to_close, date_closed, n_opts, options, q_status, q_type

Market data
	6413 sometimes has no result in market data, I suspect there's no result in many of them!
	Year 3 lacks the options that were bet on (`answer_option`), why?
		Could it be that `outcome` in some files is actually the answer option?
	With year 2/3 data, is the field price the price before or after the trade?

Finally execute it on the whole data

Forecasters ranked by previous performance
	Add the option to pass user-defined data along in `calculate_aggregate_score`
	Separate function to add cumulative user performance to DataFrame
		* parameters: dataset with forecasts, caller-defined scoring rule
		* outputs: input dataframe with cumulative scoring rule value & percentile among all forecasters

Inkling data still fishy
